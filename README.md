A guided breathing coach that helps you set a calm rhythm and follow it with a clean, modern UI.

## Features
- Guided breathing timer with phase-based progress
- Presets for common breathing patterns
- Adjustable durations and session length (minutes)
- Optional phase sound and vibration feedback
- Multi-language UI (English, Spanish, French, Polish)

## Technical
This is an Expo app using Expo Router.

### Run with Expo
1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2) Start the app
```bash
npx expo start
```

You can open it in Expo Go, an Android emulator, or the iOS simulator from the Expo CLI.

### iOS (Xcode)
If you need a native iOS build, the easiest path is:
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```
This generates the native project (if needed), installs Pods, and launches the app in the iOS simulator.
