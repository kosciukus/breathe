# Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 2025

Mindful Breathe is designed to help you build calm breathing habits. We respect your privacy and keep data collection to a minimum.

## Information We Collect

We do not ask for your name, email address, or other personal identifiers to use the app. Your breathing settings and preferences are stored locally on your device so you can keep your experience consistent.

## How We Use Information

Any data stored on your device is used only to power app features such as breathing presets, session timing, and optional feedback settings. We do not sell or share this information.

## Analytics and Third-Party Services

We do not include third-party analytics or advertising SDKs in the app. If this changes in the future, we will update this policy and provide details about what data is collected and why.

## Data Retention

Your preferences remain on your device until you reset them or uninstall the app. We do not retain copies on our servers because we do not collect them.

## Children’s Privacy

Mindful Breathe is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us so we can help.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
